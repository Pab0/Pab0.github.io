		<h2>Greetings, human</h2>
		Welcome to my tiny personal webpage. <br>
		Until I get around to make a more polished website and get a proper domain, this should act as a hub linking to any other profiles and containing basic info about myself.
		<h3>Basic info:</h3>
		<u>Studies:</u><br>
		Currently studying Computer Science at the University of Piraeus, Greece.<br><br>
		<u>Interests</u>:<br>
		<ul>
	<li>Programming. Java is probably my go-to language, especially for larger projects. I find myself hacking the smaller ones together mostly in Bash, and enjoy dabbling in other languages too. </li>
	<li>Artificial Intelligence. My thesis is on an application of Machine Learning.</li>
	<li>Open source. Some years ago I switched to GNU/Linux as my main OS and haven't looked back (I guess I got lucky with my computer's drivers ;)). I like participating in open source communities.</li>
		</ul>
